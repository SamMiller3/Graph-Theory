# Algorithms on graphs 

I have implemented several graph theory algorithms in my own interpretation of them based on how I think about them in my head.

## Floyd-Warshall

Given an adjacency matrix produce a least distance matrix and route table providing the shortest distance and route between each node on a graph.

## Prims

Given an adjacency matrix find a minimum spanning tree

## Djisktras

A greedy algorithm to find the shortest distances and routes between a source node and all other nodes on a graph
